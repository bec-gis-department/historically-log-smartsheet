# Summarize & Log Smartsheet Data to Visualize

Capture data from one Smartsheet, summarize/categorize this data and log this information daily into another Smartsheet. 

**Why?**

Well honestly I have had a pretty direct request to do something that requires this, but hey take whatchu need from me, and live in this totally relate-able example: 

Picture that you have a huge Smartsheet that is updated by a variety of departments in your organization. Your boss wants to see specific information from that sheet in a cool Smartsheet Dashboard visualization.
 
**Pretty Straight forward right?**

**Wrong!** 

They wants the ability to see this information day by day, and analyze it temporally. 

But you're cool, you know some Python, and you have a Smartsheet account so you build a script that takes that information, manipulates it and logs it into a Smartsheet. You then build an awesome Dashboard from this information and your boss loves you.

## Things Python Needs...

Well, I mainly work with Python 2.7 and I know that is going to Deprecate next year so keep an eye out for the move to python 3 but for now we use 2.7!

About the only thing you'll need to install is the [Smartsheet Python SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-python-sdk)
```bash
pip install smartsheet-python-sd
```

## Usage


## Important Things to Note:

Smartsheet can only store so much data so just make sure you summarize as much as possible, my example will be pretty light-weight but conceptually its cool
